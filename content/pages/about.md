# Hi. I'm Fitzy. I code things.

My name is John "Fitzy" DeLancey, and I'm a primarily .Net software developer and consultant focused on Software-as-a-Service in the fintech and online learning spaces.

### My Path

I began programming computers on a toy Pre-Computer 1000 at the age of 11 and haven't stopped since.

I met my first client and began software development consulting 10 years later in PHP and MySQL, then spent 4 years in the U.S. Air Force serving as a nuclear missile officer before returning home to begin a full-time career as a developer.

After 2 years working for a billion dollar multi-industry company in the power, manufacturing, and ecommerce realms, I started my consultancy, White Raven Technology LLC, and began consulting full-time.

### My Specialty

These days, I specialize in full-ish stack development with emphasis on backend development (I'll build frontend, but it's not my forte') using my favorite tech stack.

### My Favorite Tech and Tools

My go-to tech stack these days begins with .Net Core:

- ASP.Net Core as UI layer (MVC or API primarily)
- Entity Framework Core ORM for code-first data management
- Azure cloud hosting for hosting, project management, and CI/CD pipeline management

I also dabble in Node.js for static site hosting and experimentation, particularly in blockchain development and implementation.
