Blockchain development doesn't have to be hard.

Really.

## The Problem

I wanted to develop software for "the blockchain" since I first began to understand what a blockchain is and the power it offers when done well.

But good lord. Talk about a lot to figure out.

Just getting a handle on how most blockchains work can be a lot. THEN you get to try to figure out what a smart contract is, how to deploy one, and the language you're required to write one in.

Then there's how to test your contracts, paying and optimizing fees to operate your contracts, etc., all on a public blockchain (in most instances), so protecting critical data becomes a major factor.

Enter Dragonchain.
